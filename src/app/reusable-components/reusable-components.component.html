<h2>Reusable Components</h2>

<h4>Generate Details Component</h4>

<div *ngIf="praxis">
  <p>The lecture details should be reusable, that's why they will have an extra component from now on. Just cut out the
    HTML code about the details from <b>timetable.component.html</b>. It is the whole ui form. Generate the component
    and paste it in <b>lecture-details.component.html</b>.</p>
  <p class="ui message black"> <code>ng g component lecture-details</code></p>
  <p>If we want to use the details component not just for a selected item but also for every lecture item, we need to
    change <code>selectedLecture</code> to <code>lecture</code> again.</p>
  <p>The event property in <b>lecture-details.component.html</b> must be an input property that is commented on by the
    <code>@Input()</code> decorator, as it binds the external <code>LectureItemComponent</code> to it.</p>
  <p class="ui message black"><code>@Input() lecture: Lecture;</code></p>
  <p>This results in making these imports:</p>
  <p class="ui message black"><code>
      import &#123; Component, OnInit, Input &#125; from '@angular/core';<br/>
      import &#123; Lecture &#125; from '../shared/lecture';</code></p>
  <p>And put this in the <b>timetable.component.hmtl</b>:</p>
  <p class="ui message black"><code>
          &lt;app-lecture-details [lecture]="selectedLecture"&gt;&lt;/app-lecture-details&gt;
</code></p>
</div>

<div *ngIf="theorySmall" style="margin-top: 20px;">
  <p>This component receives a lecture object through its lecture property and indicates that. Now every time the user
    selects a lecture from the list this lecture will be displayed in the details component.</p>
  <p>With the selector <code>app-lecture-details</code> the component can be displayed.</p>
  <p><code>[lecture]="selectedLecture"</code> creates a one-way-binding from the <code>selectedLecture</code> property
    of the <code>TimetableComponent</code> to the <code>lecture</code> property of the target element, which is
    assigned to the <code>lecture</code> property of the <code>LectureDetailsComponent</code>.</p>
  <p>If the user clicks on an item from that list, the <code>selectedLecture</code> changes, this updates the <code>lecture</code>
    because of the property-binding and the <code>LectureDetailsComponent</code> displayes the chosen object.</p>
  <p>In this section, there were just "inside changes", you cannot see any difference in the user interface. But we
    seperated the list and the details-view. Now a development of both components is possible, without any need to also
    change the other one. The details-component is now resusable.</p>
